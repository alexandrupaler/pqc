# Practical Quantum Computing

## Motivation
Quantum computing promises a technical revolution, but what exactly does it refer to? Popular science articles often talk about qubit, entanglement, algorithm, quantum chemistry and the discovery of new drugs and materials. It is important to introduce the foundations of quantum computing, from a practical, realistic and (whenever possible) visual perspective. Quantum communication networks are already used for communicating across continents (Europe-Asia), and the first small scale quantum computers are available in the cloud for experiments. Nevertheless, industrially relevant quantum computing seems to be at least a decade away, because quantum error correction is a necessity but the current hardware is too resource restricted.

## Objectives
Introduce the theory and practice necessary for answering:
* What is quantum computing and what are quantum computers?
* What is quantum supremacy, or when will quantum computers become more powerful/relevant than classical ones?
* What can be computed with the currently available quantum chips (NISQ)?
* How does one use the current available quantum chips?
* How is arithmetic performed on a quantum computer?
* What is the surface code? What is braiding? Lattice surgery?

## Structure
10+ lecture units and 10+ tutorial units.

The materials focus on hands on exercises with state of the art software tools, such as Google Cirq, IBM QisKit.
